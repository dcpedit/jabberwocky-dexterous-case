# Stacked Acrylic Case for Jabberwocky Dexterous Keyboard

These files are for laser printing a stacked acrylic case for the Jabberwocky Dexterous keyboard using 3mm thick acrylic sheets.  The switch plate layer was designed for the PCB version that I have, so a different PCB will require modifications to the orientation of the stablizer holes.  As-is, the case will fit the below PCB (plase note stabalizer orientation)
